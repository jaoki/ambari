This is to compare source code revisions (aka git hashes) when ambari-server and ambari-agent are built, and show warnnings if not match.

### Assumption
src_revision files should be generated by ambari build (when rpm is built).
The trigger should be the same when {buildNumber} in ./ambari-server/sbin/ambari-server is replaced

```
Agent has 
/var/lib/ambari-agent/src_revision

server has
/var/lib/ambari-server/resources/src_revision
```

or maybe the HASH can be read from ambari-server and ambari-agent shell script
